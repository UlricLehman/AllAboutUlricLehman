     <h1>Welcome to the Secret Ulric Page!</h1>

    <p>I LOVE <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgBPuTX7crv_2jKAkH5z7bA">Orangestar</a>'s music! Why do I love Orangestar's music so much? Here are 3 reasons why!</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Because it's so uplifting!
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Even if you don't know the words to the music, the way that the music is written just hits you with
                    a positive energy to where you feel that you feel invincible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Because of this Uplifting mood it's super easy to put it on, and people aren't super against it even
                    if you don't know the words.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Perfect summer music!
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A lot of the music are talking about summer and how joyful that a time it can be. The freedom that is felt
                    is very amazing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Very often summer music is portrayed in such a negative light, however, this artist truly embraces the
                    freedom that summer can offer, which makes me feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Finally, because the music is challenging to sing.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    While some people find this to be more of a detractor, I believe that it is a very good thing.
                    Namely it makes it satisfying to be a fan of their music, because it's so fast.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It also gives me a good excuse to come back to listen to more.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol> <br>
